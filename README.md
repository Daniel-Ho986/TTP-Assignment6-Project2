Project 2: 
City Search App

- In this project we will allow the user to provide us a City name and we will display all of the associated zip codes to the user.

- Using the same API as project 1, we will build a City search app, where given a city name, we will display all returned zip codes.

Primary Tasks

Using the same ctp-zip-api we used in project 1:
http://ctp-zip-api.herokuapp.com/city/SPRINGFIELD

- Implement a City Search field that takes city names
    - It should allow city names to be entered in upper, lower, or mixed case letters
- Display all zip codes received from the API
